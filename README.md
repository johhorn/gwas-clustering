# gwas-clustering
Code and data for the master thesis on tools for clustering of diseases and traits, as represented by Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) data sets.

The majority of the code available in this repository is part of the Genomic HyperBrowser, an open source, web-based software system for comparative genomic analysis. The HyperBrowser is developed and supported by the BMI research group at UiO and the Radium Hospital in Oslo.

Most of the code provided cannot be run as standalone scripts, as they rely on the HyperBrowser framework, in particular the files of tools, statistics and general helper classes. These tools and statistics provide different implementations for feature representation and comparison of genomic tracks. The tracks represent diseases and traits, and represented by associated variants from Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS). In addition to HyperBrowser code, scripts for LD computation for variants, as given by their rsids, is provided.
