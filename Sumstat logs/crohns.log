--sumstats EUR.CD.filtered.assoc 

Interpreting column names as follows:
INFO:	INFO score (imputation quality; higher --> better imputation)
A1:	Allele 1, interpreted as ref allele for signed sumstat.
P:	p-Value
A2:	Allele 2, interpreted as non-ref allele for signed sumstat.
SNP:	Variant ID (e.g., rs number)
OR:	Odds ratio (1 --> no effect; above 1 --> A1 is risk increasing)

Reading sumstats from EUR.CD.filtered.assoc into memory 5000000 SNPs at a time.
Read 12276495 SNPs from --sumstats file.
Removed 0 SNPs with missing values.
Removed 5475789 SNPs with INFO <= 0.9.
Removed 0 SNPs with MAF <= 0.01.
Removed 0 SNPs with out-of-bounds p-values.
Removed 1463994 variants that were not SNPs or were strand-ambiguous.
5336712 SNPs remain.
Removed 2 SNPs with duplicated rs numbers (5336710 SNPs remain).
Using N = 20883.0
Median value of OR was 1.0001, which seems sensible.
Writing summary statistics for 5336710 SNPs (5336710 with nonmissing beta) to crohns.sumstats.gz.

Metadata:
