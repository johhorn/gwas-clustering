--N 95454.0 \
--sumstats ldl.tbl.sorted 

Interpreting column names as follows:
MarkerName:	Variant ID (e.g., rs number)
Weight:	Sample size
Allele2:	Allele 2, interpreted as non-ref allele for signed sumstat.
Allele1:	Allele 1, interpreted as ref allele for signed sumstat.
GC.Zscore:	Z-score (0 --> no effect; above 0 --> A1 is trait/risk increasing)
GC.Pvalue:	p-Value

Reading sumstats from ldl.tbl.sorted into memory 5000000 SNPs at a time.
Read 2692564 SNPs from --sumstats file.
Removed 0 SNPs with missing values.
Removed 0 SNPs with INFO <= 0.9.
Removed 0 SNPs with MAF <= 0.01.
Removed 0 SNPs with out-of-bounds p-values.
Removed 414059 variants that were not SNPs or were strand-ambiguous.
2278505 SNPs remain.
Removed 0 SNPs with duplicated rs numbers (2278505 SNPs remain).
Removed 277594 SNPs with N < 63636.0 (2000911 SNPs remain).
Median value of GC.Zscore was 0.001, which seems sensible.
Writing summary statistics for 2000911 SNPs (2000911 with nonmissing beta) to ldl.sumstats.gz.
