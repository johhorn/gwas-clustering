Interpreting column names as follows:
effect:	[linear/logistic] regression coefficient (0 --> no effect; above 0 --> A1 is trait/risk increasing)
other_allele:	Allele 2, interpreted as non-ref allele for signed sumstat.
snp:	Variant ID (e.g., rs number)
maf:	Allele frequency
effect_allele:	Allele 1, interpreted as ref allele for signed sumstat.
pvalue:	p-Value

Reading sumstats from fasting_glucose.txt into memory 5000000 SNPs at a time.
Read 2470476 SNPs from --sumstats file.
Removed 0 SNPs with missing values.
Removed 0 SNPs with INFO <= 0.9.
Removed 52606 SNPs with MAF <= 0.01.
Removed 0 SNPs with out-of-bounds p-values.
Removed 372966 variants that were not SNPs or were strand-ambiguous.
2044904 SNPs remain.
Removed 0 SNPs with duplicated rs numbers (2044904 SNPs remain).
Using N = 58074.0
Median value of effect was 0.0, which seems sensible.
