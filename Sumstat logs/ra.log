Interpreting column names as follows:
A1:	Allele 1, interpreted as ref allele for signed sumstat.
OR:	Odds ratio (1 --> no effect; above 1 --> A1 is risk increasing)
SNPID:	Variant ID (e.g., rs number)
A2:	Allele 2, interpreted as non-ref allele for signed sumstat.
P-val:	p-Value

Reading sumstats from rheumatoid_arthritis_broadinstitute into memory 5000000 SNPs at a time.
Read 8747962 SNPs from --sumstats file.
Removed 0 SNPs with missing values.
Removed 0 SNPs with INFO <= 0.9.
Removed 0 SNPs with MAF <= 0.01.
Removed 0 SNPs with out-of-bounds p-values.
Removed 1344225 variants that were not SNPs or were strand-ambiguous.
7403737 SNPs remain.
Removed 0 SNPs with duplicated rs numbers (7403737 SNPs remain).
Using N = 58284.0
Median value of OR was 1.0, which seems sensible.
